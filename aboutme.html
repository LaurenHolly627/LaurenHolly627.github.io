<h1>About Me!</h1>

Here is a little about me. I am a student of Data Science at
<a href="http://www.uri.edu"> URI </a>.  I plan on minoring in German, so that one day I can hopefully get a job in Germany. <br>
        I decided to take this course as a means to get a good base for learning how to code in other, 
        perhaps more difficult languages, that could help me in my field and for personal use. <br>
        I'd like to know how to code basic games and websites. 
        Besides Data Science, I'd also like to become proffiecient in coding so as to get involved in robotics.
